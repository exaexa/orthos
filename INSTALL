Basically, you should be able to install the thing via install.sh, default
PREFIX is `/usr/local/'. If you don't have SCons, don't have sumthing else, or
just are elitist, compile with gcc:

a] things in ./src/ to `orthos' binary (main plugin bin)
b] things in ./skins/ to some reasonable .so with -fPIC and -shared . This
   results to a default skin.

You need libraries: 

libX11, libXmu, crypt, dl - for main binary
SDL, GL, freetype - for default plugin

dont forget to add freetype include path, eg. -I/usr/include/freetype2/


After compiling and installing things you should look at src/settings.cpp,
there is a lot of default options which you might want to alter. Config file
is specified as the only orthos parameter (defaulted to /etc/orthos.conf) and
please note it's to be separated by TABS, I mean '\t' not any spaces or wut.
Any line that doesn't contain a tab is a comment.
